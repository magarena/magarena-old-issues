      "body": "Thanks for catching this. In our switch of kicker to the new additional cost system, I only tested to make sure the player payed the cost. Since the player pays by tapping lands it works fine. The AI on the other hand doesn't directly tap lands, it just determines a way to pay. The cost event itself needs to make the AI pay up.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
