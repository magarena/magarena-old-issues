      "body": "Finally crushed the bug. The reason was that the static effect wasn't affecting the permanent in the AI's instance of the game. This is due to a subtle bug in the copying of the game state which caused the same permanent in the regular game to get copied multiple times. This caused the enchantedCreature reference in the Aura to be different from the permanent reference obtained from the controller.",
