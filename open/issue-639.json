      "body": "Do you mean the game log or the prompt? For example, if I play Temple Garden the prompt will display \"Proceed with \"may\" action?\" and display Temple Garden in blue above it. If I move the mouse cursor over the prompt it displays the card image although it is a very small \"hit\" area which needs looking at. Plus, I am not sure whether I even like this feature - I would prefer it if the card was displayed to you full size with the prompt next to it since it is not always obvious to me that the prompt is actually waiting for me to respond.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the log I think any card name displayed in the log should be a hot link that can be clicked or hovered-over to display the associated card image. I think it would be quite a challenge UI component-wise but not impossible.",
