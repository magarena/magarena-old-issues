      "body": "previously Vines of Vastwood gives the hexproof ability to the creature, this is incorrect as \"opponent\" in hexproof is resolved at the point of targeting and is decided based on the controller of the creature. This works fine if Vines of Vastwood is only used to target your own creatures. The correct way is to fix \"opponent\" to be the \"opponent of controller of the spell\" at the point the ability is applied.\r\n\r\nSee http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=324750 for more discussions of using Vines of Vastwood to prevent your opponent from targeting their own creature.\r\n\r\nFixed for 1.15\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
