      "body": "Thanks for the report, this is easily reproducible.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes from MagicPlayer.getNrOfAttackers returning an int that's set in MagicDeclareAttackersAction but doesn't take into account that MagicPermanentState.Attacking can be set through other means. I suggest we don't store the number of attackers but count them when needed, e.g.\r\n\r\npublic int getNrOfAttackers() {\r\n  int count=0;\r\n  for (final MagicPermanent permanent : permanents) {\r\n    if (permanent.hasState(MagicPermanentState.Attacking)) {\r\n      count++;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return count;\r\n}\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
