      "body": "After discussion on forum with judges and palyer i found arule for that kind of triggers:\r\n\r\n\r\n603.6  Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called \"zone-change triggers.\" Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponentâ€™s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers. \r\n\r\nThe main word are: \"During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to.\" So the current behavior is ok.",
