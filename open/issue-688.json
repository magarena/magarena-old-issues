      "body": "AI make a decision at the start of the turn for cards with mana_or_combat on whether to exclude them from combat and use them for mana. It shows \"...\" on the choice panel when the AI is making this decision.\r\n\r\nThe logic is in MagicExcludeChoice.getArtificialOptions @ src/magic/model/choice/MagicExcludeChoice.java\r\n\r\nIn particular, if there are more than 3 of such permanents around, it always excludes all of them from combat. Could be causing issues in such decks. For 3 or less, it considers all possible options. I suppose the reason for the 3 or more heuristic is to avoid the huge number of possible options (for 4, there are 16 options).\r\n\r\nPersonally I wonder if this special AI only decision is needed at all? What if we remove it altogether and decide on the fly rather than at the start of the turn?",
