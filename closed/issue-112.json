What happens is:\r\n- permanent activation get's added to AEther Vial\r\n- MagicCMCTargetFilter is called and at that point is has zero counters so cmc==0\r\n- when conditions are met MagicCMCTargetFilter's accept method is called but cmc will still be zero\r\n\r\nThe affected cards used to work in 1.19, so 1.20 broke something and I'm trying to figure out what changes are responsible. The only possible revisions I can find are revision 65f74d84bf22 and revision fce381bcf2a0 .\r\n\r\nStill doesn't make sense to me",

      "body": "@beholder The situation is indeed as you've described. The previous limitation is that getTargetChoice (which is used to find the set of legal targets of an effect) is called once when the activation is linked to the card, hence it cannot depend on the source of the activation. I'm not sure how it would have worked in 1.19...\r\n\r\nI've change it so that getTargetChoice is called each time the game checks for legal targets and it now takes in a parameter that represents the source of the activation.\r\n\r\nBtw, there is no need to check for existence of legal targets as a activation condition, this is handled by the game engine, see MagicActivation.canPlay method. For example, the MagicCondition.HAS_CREATURE_WITH_CMC_CONDITION for AEther Vial is redundant.",
