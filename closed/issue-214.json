Now it correctly targets every human on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty confident that my change fixes your issue but I'm surprised that, when reading through the game.log, it seems there were no human creatures in play when Scorch the Fields was cast.",

I was mistaken as I see the Lifesmith now.\r\n\r\nMy fix is correct but my description of the problem wrongly states \"only targeting humans controlled by its controller\" but the bug was that damage was only done to humans controlled by the opponent. The game.log confirms this is what happened.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, thanks again for the report. Another bug squashed!",
