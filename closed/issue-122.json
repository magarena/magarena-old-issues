(it's now 4/3)\r\nLOG: Player attacks with Laccolith Grunt.\r\nLOG: Computer blocks with Diregraf Ghoul (2/2 + Giant Growth = 5/5)\r\nLOG: Player may (yes) have Laccolith Grunt deal damage equal to its power to target creature (Diregraf Ghoul).\r\nLOG: Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to target creature or player (Laccolith Grunt). Laccolith Grunt is destroyed. Unholy Strength is put into its owner's graveyard. (resolves before Laccolith Grunt's ability)\r\n\r\nresult: Laccolith Grunt's ability deals 2 damage to Diregraf Ghoul\r\n\r\nThe rule we fail to obey:\r\n112.7a Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won‘t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, ―Prodigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to target creature or player) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source because the effect needs to be divided checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it‘s expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above the outcome of my earlier example should be that Laccolith Grunt deals 4 damage instead of 2 because last time it was on the battlefield it was at pt=4/3.",
