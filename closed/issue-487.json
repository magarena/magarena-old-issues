I have updated the calculation for the splash message to filter out tokens assuming that a token file has \"token\" in the filename. Interestingly, it still seems to be out by one or two which might be down to an incorrectly named token file.\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n  **Labels:** -Type- Type-Defect  \n",
