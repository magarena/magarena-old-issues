But even if that was true, if it was \"draw 1 card\" that would be a timing advantage potentially. What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. 2. 3. What is the expected output?

      "body": "There is an option in the preferences named \"Skip single option choices when appropriate\". It is enabled by default. When it is enabled, the game automatically passed priority for you if passing is the only option. I'm guessing that this is what happened: after you manually passed the declare attackers step, the only option is to pass which the game did for you.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to play by manually passing priority, just disable that option. \r\n\r\nI'll close this issue. If you noticed any strange timing bugs, do create a new issue.\n\n**Status:** CantReproduce  \n",
