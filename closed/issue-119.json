      "body": "You can still save the deck when the duel is over (after 3/5/7/9 or 11 games), but that's not a very elegant solution as it could mean choosing 'concede game' a lot of times only to be able to save a cool deck.\r\nI don't know why the 'save deck' menu option is disabled to be honest. The code simply disables the top four menu items in the duel menu while a duel is ongoing.\r\n\r\nI agree it should be possible to save decks between matches so I'll enable the menu option.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n  **Labels:** -Type-Defect Type-Enhancement  \n",
