      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've not been able to replicate this by casting from the player or AI. It could be that there are existing permanents on the battlefield that trigger on either an instant being cast, or an Arcane spell. (Unfortunately not tested on version 1.51)\r\n\r\nIf not, then maybe an update to version 1.52 will fix this (Plus give you a bundle of new cards!)\r\n\r\nDo reply if this occurs again - it could be that some effects from the 'other games' the AI is playing to decide the best choice are sneaking in again. ;)",
