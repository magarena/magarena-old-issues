The actual code for rendering the highlight can be found in ImageCardListViewer towards the bottom of PaintComponent() but I can't imagine you will need to change this. So at a guess I would say you could set the focus to the required viewer/zone using a similar solution to that found for issue 570 and then call GameController.setValidChoices() to highlight the cards.",

They are far too small and apart from the exile and special buttons they actually replicate the icons used next to the avatar image.
