      "body": "Hehe, this is why copying things is just a complete minefield!\r\n\r\nThe difference is, when you copy a kicker spell, you can't pay it's kicker cost if the original copy didn't pay for it.\r\nIf the original version had paid for it, you get that as well when you copy it.\r\n\r\nReplicate feels like a kicker, but it's not. It's an ability that triggers when it's cast. As copies are never cast, it doesn't trigger, regardless of whether the replicate cost was paid. It is an additional cost, and so it knows whether the cost was paid, but can't do anything about it.\r\n\r\nIf Replicate was like kicker, when you pay the replicate cost once, each copy would then put another copy of it onto the stack - and so on into infinity.\r\n\r\nKicker is an additional cost to casting a spell, and as additional costs are copied, you get the kicker effect. Only because the spells normally state, \"If you paid the kicker cost... etc\" which is different to \"When you cast SN, if the kicker cost was paid...\" which would mean it wouldn't trigger.\r\n\r\nHope that makes some more sense",
