      "body": "I'm not sure this feature is necessary. If you have more than one copy of a card and you remove it, it still selects the copy you have left. If you remove all copies, it doesn't select anything, because it can't predict what card you want to change next.\r\n\r\nThis feature seems to select the spot where the last removed card was, which is only useful if you happen to have 2 cards in a row that you need to remove.\r\n\r\nI'm going to enable multiple card selection instead, as that would address the problem (of removing multiple cards quickly) more directly.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
