In that case, well we don't store that information at the moment but it would certainly be possible to download such info and use it as a filter.\r\n\r\nConsider this something we will look in to.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n  **Labels:** -Type-Defect -Priority-Medium Type-Enhancement Priority-Low  \n",
