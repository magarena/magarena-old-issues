Additional costs, though may be paid - mandatory additional cost must be paid.\r\n\r\ne.g.: Violent Outburst cascades into Vines of Vastwood, you should be propted to pay the kicker cost. Same when imprinting Vines of Vastwood onto Isocrone Scepter and casting a copy of the spell from there.",

      "body": "... same goes for Replicate, which is an addition cost, too\r\n\r\n702.55a Replicate is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. The second is a triggered ability that functions while the spell is on the stack. “Replicate [cost]” means “As an additional cost to play this spell, you may pay [cost] any number of times” and “When you cast this spell, if a replicate cost was paid for it, copy it for each time its replicate cost was paid. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for any number of the copies.”",
