      "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nThis bug affects every creature with kicker cost and a 'comes into play' (citp) ability. It's because the kicker implementation also handles the citp effect and since the copy isn't cast, the whole kicker code is skipped.\r\n\r\nThe ComeIntoPlayTrigger must always be there but the amount should be changed by the MagicSpellCardEvent somehow.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
