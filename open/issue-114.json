The Pump timing doesn't allow casting or activating abilities during a block phase.\r\n\r\nIf the AI has something in hand which could be cast as an instant, and 'waiting to see' if a creature would be blocked, it's unable to activate or cast anything in response. All Pump activations assume aggressive play, not defensive or reactionary. The 'Response' in the MagicTimings only takes into account items on stack.\r\n\r\nAdding Declare Blockers step to Pump timing may help",
