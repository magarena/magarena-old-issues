Then I'll open a new issue that will track possible enhancements we can add to the history file. That could indeed mean that at some point the history view needs a different place or like you mentioned, keep the basic stats easily visible and have all statistics in a different window. we'll see.\r\n\r\nAs this issue clearly belongs to issue 100 , I asked Melvin to merge them.",
