If it's possible to create a separate 'play area' for them would help a lot, and keep them out of the way from other cards that could end up interacting with them (turning them into creatures etc.) That zone could then be emptied at the end of every phase.",

      "body": "I've read something like that, too. The AI depends on the assumption, that every manasource produces exactly one mana.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, that would be true for the mana tokens, too... they produce exacly one mana and are removed afterwards. And a very specific mana at that as well - you would need only 6 mana tokens: white, blue, black, red, green and colorless. Phyrexian mana, hybrid mana, snow, \"mana of any color\", all that does not go to the mana pool - you have to make a choice beforehand what will be.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand though, I don't understand well, how the AI works.",
