      "body": "Hehe, yeah, would probably help to explain that further:\r\n\r\nI'm wanting to make a White and Blue deck:-\r\nSelecting White and Blue in the color filters and choosing:\r\n\r\n'Match any' will also show White and Green cards, and Blue and Red cards (an OR selection for example).\r\nI don't want those so I then choose.\r\n\r\n'Match All Selected' This shows me all cards with White AND Blue, and other colors. So White, Green, and Blue cards are shown.\r\n\r\nStill not what I want to see.\r\n\r\nSo I then have to select Black, Red, Green then select the Exclude Selected - Just to see the cards to go in a White Blue deck (This also then shows all the Artifacts and Land as well)\r\n\r\nSo as I have to select the colors I don't want to use in a deck to show the cards I do want in a deck. Not very intuitive.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense for the Exclude Selected to instead be a checkbox, so I can select the colors I want, select 'Match Any', and then an extra filter of 'Exclude Unselected' to filter out the other colors I haven't selected.\r\n\r\nHope that's clearer - Just something that's always annoyed me when making a deck :)",
