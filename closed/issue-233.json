      "body": "Thanks for bringing this to our attention.\r\n\r\nOn default settings, the minimax AI looks 6 main phases ahead, that includes 3 combat phases. Therefore the AI has to simulate combat options for the current combat round and the next two combat rounds. Although the current combat round is simple, it has to simulate many different attacking and blocking options for the next two rounds, which may be very complicated, say in the case of a alpha strike, there are many blocking options to consider.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the AI should have been smarter and dynamically reduce the number of phases to look ahead. Ten minutes of waiting time is unacceptable. We will look into further optimizations.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
