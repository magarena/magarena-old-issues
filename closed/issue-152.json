      "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nI can confirm this happens. It's because the game only evaluates cards on the battlefield. So when Dread moves from the battlefield to the graveyard, it will get shuffled back into the library. When it moves from the library to the graveyard, abilities are never read so there is nothing to trigger.\r\nThis was most likely done as a way to lower the number of options the AI has to consider and it's why we don't support casting from the graveyard and effects like that. Cards like Dread and Vigor shouldn't have been added for the above reason.\r\n\r\nThe best solution IMHO would be to remove those two cards, because adding support for them would be a major undertaking and might not be possible without sacrificing AI speed.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",

      "body": "Actually we do support \"when X enters the graveyard\" triggers, seems that our implementation misses the case when a card enters the graveyard from the library. In particular, for Dread and other incarnations, the trigger does not require any decisions to be made so there is no effect on AI. We probably should fix them.",
