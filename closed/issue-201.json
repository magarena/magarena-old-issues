      "body": "I'd love to see Magarena available in native package formats. Storing data that have to be downloaded in a ~/.Magarena folder would be the way to go. There is also some benefit to our current portable folder style install. One way which will work for both types of installation is to have the program check for card images and text from either the Magarena subfolder where the program is installed or the ~/.Magarena folder.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
