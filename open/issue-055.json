      "body": "Hi, thanks for your interest and kind words.\r\n\r\nFor personal use you can replace the images in Magarena/cards/ with the chinese card images and just make sure the file names are the same.\r\nI see you made a clone, so you can also edit the \\resources\\magic\\data\\cards.txt and cards2.txt and change the lines that point to the image url (image= http://magiccards.info/... ) to point to the chinese versions.\r\n\r\nChanging the UI messages would be a lot of work because many card classes also have english text in them.\r\n\r\nMaybe this can eventually be a user preference in Magarena. Loading a different set of images seems quite easy to do but I don't know how much work it would be to change the messages in game.",
