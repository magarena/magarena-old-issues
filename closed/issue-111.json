      "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\n- The bug with echo costs has been fixed. See issue 106 for details.\r\n- I can't reproduce the regeneration bug you describe. Maybe it's caused by some interaction with other cards/effects. Please file a new report with any details about which cards were in play etc., when you ever see the bug happening again.\r\n- I had no problem using Recurring Nightmare's ability. It does require you to have another creature in play and can only be played as a sorcery, so maybe the problem lies there?\r\n- The bug with Gemstone Mine was fixed a few days ago. See issue 104 .\r\n- The bug with Joraga Warcaller (and other cards) has been fixed too. See issue 105 .\r\n\r\nFeel free to open a new report for any bug you think is not resolved and please make a separate issue for each bug you find, it's much cleaner that way.\r\n\r\nThanks for the kind words too :D\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
