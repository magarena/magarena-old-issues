The list should shift to the left and show the right-most columns. Instead, the list does not move (or only moves vertically). What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Magarena 1.24, Mac OS X 10.7.3. If you are reporting a game play bug, please attach your game.log file. If you are reporting a crash, please attach both crash.log and game.log files (both files are found in the main game folder). Please provide any additional information below. Using the bottom scroll thumb for horizontal scrolling works, but is cumbersom. Most Mac applications have a working 2-finger-trackpad or mouse horizontal scroll.

It would be convenient to be able to easily see the right-most columns of the card list by simply swiping 2 fingers horizontally.\r\n\r\nAnyway, keep up the good work!  I had been waiting anxiously for the March version, and I'm very happy it's now available. :)",
