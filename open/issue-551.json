      "body": "Way to push the limits!\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is probably due to the max value of an int being 2,147,483,647\r\n\r\nI'm guessing it was safe to assume that a value wouldn't need to be that high (this includes life, poison(!), etc. as well), and that although an 'issue' - I doubt that the work involved to replace all int with long would be for much benefit.",

      "body": "yes, I know. The amount of counters became negative, thus the Hydra's toughness became 0 again, most likely that's what happened.\r\n\r\nAs of why: testing is to break to product on purpose. that's why. and it goes hand in hand with a game like magic. Magic The Gathering is all about rules and how to bent and exploit them. And I did it just to see how far it goes.\r\n\r\nWell I had another reason, I half-expected a mayor slowdown with so much counters present - which didn't happen. Which in turn is good, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI didn't intend to create extra work - leave it as it is, for all I care. I just mentioned it, because it is something that could easily be dealt with. If the amount of counters exceeds 1000 it is set to 1000. Maybe in conjunction with a notification concerning counters exceeded. Which could be done once and extended/inherited to all possible counters. But then again, that's your call.",

      "body": "I always thought the sheer amount of +1/+1 counters would cause serious hang-ups on magarena, but I think I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nYou see, when I got the Mycloth/Cather's Crusade Combo out almost immediatly I got the hang-ups. I tried it again, this time, though, Cather's Crusade came late to my hand. Mycloth alone was enough to cause hang-ups, just at a smaller rate.\r\n\r\nWhen I write hang-up than I mean magarana was for a short period of time unresponsive. I wouldn't get a tooltip or thumpnail, I wouldn't be able to click anything in the window, the escape-key wouldn'T work... that kind of hang-up.\r\n\r\nBy the time I got Cather's Crusade out on the battlefield, the hang-ups lasts about 5-8 seconds each (every time you pass priority). After it was triggered, the hang-ups grew in duration. I cancelled the game, when each of them would last more than 30 seconds.\r\n\r\ngame.log: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sc5jl4lk7smy08i/hang-up_game.log",
