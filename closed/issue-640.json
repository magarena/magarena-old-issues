This was a bit of a pain to implement but I think I have covered all possible use cases. It is actually a bit more advanced than the previous mechanism - now it takes into account older versions such that if someone who is using 1.51 upgrades directly to 1.53 via import the new cards filter option will display all new cards added in 1.52 and 1.53. As before if you run a nightly build or sync your local copy of the repository the new cards list will be updated to only reflect any new cards added. Now though, you can always reset the new list by importing a previous release (eg. 1.52).\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
