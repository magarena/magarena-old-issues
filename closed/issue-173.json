      "body": "Thanks for the report. I can reproduce this.\r\n\r\nA card like 'Day of Judgment' makes a list of all the creatures then destroys 1 at a time. Once Knight Exemplar is destroyed, the other knights on that list have lost their indestructible ability and will also be destroyed. Since the list is sorted alphabetically, Angelfire Crusader lives and White Knight dies.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this is to pass a list to MagicDestroyAction, let it build a list of creatures that will be destroyed and lastly, remove those from play.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
