      "body": "Thank you for the report.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to an issue we hope is resolved ( issue 26 ). Now, I'm having a hard time trying to reproduce this. I played multiple test games and in those the MCTS AI doesn't do what you describe. That doesn't mean I think it can't be, but it means I'll need more details of what the game looked like when you saw this happening. Things like the card it kept re-equipping, what equipment was it, remaining life, anything that can help us reproduce this issue will get us closer to a possible solution.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
