OPTIONAL: Have at least one of these copies die by any means (if testing with Twilight Drover) What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Chronozoa's ability specifically states to put two tokens that are copies of it on the battlefield.  The game does not see these copies as tokens, and as such do not gain the benefit of global enchantments such as Intangible Virtue (+1/+1 and vigilance to tokens), nor do they trigger abilities such as Twilight Drover's (who gets a +1/+1 counter on it whenever a token leaves the battlefield).\r\n\r\nExtra Note:  I'm not sure, but I think the issue may also exist with the Followed Footsteps enchantment.
