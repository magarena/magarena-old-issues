( https://bitbucket.org/lodici/magarena/commits/9a8489b254ab5cc09d66f1ffe78c9a96ed51e08c ).\r\n\r\nThis now uses the \"Popup card images to original size\" setting to determine whether to show card images in the CardViewer at the new 480 x 680 size or the previous 312 x 444. To reflect its more general use I have renamed the the setting to \"Large card images\" and moved it to the \"Look & Feel\" tab. This update also fixes the problem described in comment #4 above.",

In this case I think it is not required since the current UI would not make use of it. If in future for example, there was a need to be able to adjust the size of the left-hand area of the explorer/deck editor screens then you would probably want the image to auto-scale in that case.\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
