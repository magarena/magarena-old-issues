This time I tried it with single and multiple kicks and the same thing happens. If I just let the AI go about its business then everything is just fine and dandy. If however I click twice on the OK button or the number indicating the intended kicks then the game freezes.\r\nSo basically the solution is to click only once and not to be dumb :)",
