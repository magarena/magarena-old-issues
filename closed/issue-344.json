The trick is to farm out the random play part of the algorithm to a separate core, so the main algorithm can continue to grow another part of the tree.\r\n\r\nOn a quad core machine, it able to achieve a 3x increase in number of simulations compare to the current single core one. More AI comparisons is needed to figure out if the new version wins more often than the current one.\n\n**Status:** Started  \n",
