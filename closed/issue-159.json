Because it's easier for us when each issue has one suggestion or bug, I'll make new issues for suggestions 2 to 4 and comment on the first suggestion here.\r\n\r\n1. I'm not quite sure at what point in the game you think the difference between your deck and the AI deck isn't clear. Is this on the 'New Duel' screen (where you chose colors) or while playing a match? Please elaborate as making things more obvious is important to us.\r\n\r\n2. moved to issue 160 3. moved to issue 161 4. moved to issue 162\n\n**Labels:** -Type-Defect Type-Enhancement  \n",

I guess we could put the user name in front of the deck name, i.e.\r\nPlayer - Deck (Unsaved Deck) - 40 cards\r\n\r\nBut the name of the owner of the deck is already there, next to the image on the active tab.

I updated the wiki ( https://code.google.com/p/magarena/wiki/UINewDuel ) to make that more clear.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see with adding a \"Load deck\" button is that once we do that someone else might request a \"New deck\" button, then a \"Save deck\" button, etc. And we would end up with a not very user friendly interface. Menu options may not be very visible but they are a great way to reduce screen clutter.",
