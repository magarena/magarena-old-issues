      "body": "I am not convinced that your problem is a UI issue or even specifically related to the log viewer. How can you be so sure it not the AI? Or your PC/Java config? I would have expected more complaints if recent code changes had adversely affected the UI responsiveness. From personal experience, the AI does seem to take longer to play as a game progresses which might be perceived as an increasing sluggishness in the UI.\r\n\r\nOne possible cause for a slowdown is that of a lack of memory such that the Java memory manager is constantly having to garbage collect which will manifest in drastically reduced performance.\r\n\r\nAs a further test, in build 688 ( https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/melvinzhang/job/magarena/688/ ), you can now add \"disableLogViewer\" as a command line parameter which will completely disable the UI log viewer so this will identify if the log viewer is affecting performance once and for all. Please can you try this parameter and see whether this makes any difference.\r\n\r\nOn my PC the results are not conclusive.",
