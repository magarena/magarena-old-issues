      "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nI can confirm this happens but only when the AI uses the second ability. The code correctly has the cost as {1UB}, as well as the CAN_TAP_CONDITION for both abilities. What I assume is happening is this:\r\n\r\n- AI checks 2nd ability's CAN_TAP_CONDITION and that returns true\r\n- AI checks 2nd ability's mana cost and builds a list of valid sources\r\n- 1st ability seems a valid mana source because its CAN_TAP_CONDITION returns true\r\n\r\nThis is not restricted to just this card. There are a few more cards that will have this same bug. I'll have to investigate this to see if I can come up with a solution.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
