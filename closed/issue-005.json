      "body": "Comment from David:\r\nTo build a deck using Magarena's UI is tedious. I think the biggest gripe I had was that I had to repeatedly filter cards because only one card can be selected from the filtered list. I gave up and ended up browsing cards and typing the names of those that I wanted on notepad.  I then opened an existing deck config (.dec file) using notepad (pure guess that .dec files are readable by text readers) to replace it with the cards I had chosen.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I remember correctly, the .dec format isn't automatically recognized by text readers. It was only through a guess that I realised text readers could open.dec files.  If a player didn't guess this, then he/she might find it a struggle to build a custom deck and be give up building one.\r\n\r\nImplementing a search function could make browsing cards more convenient.",
