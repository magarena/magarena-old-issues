      "body": "I have a question concerning a player being dealt damage and a player losing life:\r\n\r\nit isn't the same, is it? \r\nPariah says: damage will be redirected, a card like Blood Artist says: player loses life. As of now, Pariah does not redirect the \"losing life\" effect from Blood Artist to the enchanted creature. \r\n\r\nMy Question is: is that correct?",

      "body": "You should be able to redirect to the chosen target, that's currently not possible (I think).\r\n\r\nAs for damage dealt and losing life: Being dealt damage fits the criteria of losing life (Your life total has changed). But losing life doesn't fit the criteria of taking damage (Your life total has changed, but no damage was dealt to you).\r\n\r\nPariah will not redirect loss of life. As loss of life isn't damage.\r\n\r\nWhich is just as well, as life can be used as payment :)",
