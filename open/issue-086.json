With a computerprogram, it can show you the card sorted, without let you know the order in the library (or it can SHOW it shuffled, but keeping the order in the library).\r\nAlso the puzzle-settings must contain the AI and it's settings of strength. The AI must make the same moves, on all computers different hardware and independent of time needed.\r\n\r\nFinaly there is to specify a formular for the score in the highscore table:\r\n- one factor should be the number of turns. Winning faster, better score.\r\n- one other could be the livepoints: having more left when win, is better\r\n- there could also be done to give the computer more livepoints. Winning giving more additional livepoints than others, is better\r\n- also I thought, maybe playing with \"reverse opponent-livepoints\". So you play till you lost the game and the score is the number of live-points you added (!) to your opponent. But maybe this wouldn't be so nice, because you ALWAY lose the fight, as you play till you lost your last point and count the damagepoints.\r\n- also it could be any formular, like each livepoints left (good thing) will reduce the turn by maybe 1/5.\r\n\r\nThere are different variations, I don't know which would best.\r\n- there could be ONE score-system, where you can play different puzzles\r\n- but it would be also to \"define\" the score-system within the puzzle, so say: \"best player who needs less turns\" and in an other \"best player to save most livepoints\"\r\n\r\nMy fist INTUITIONAL proposal: maybe a combination\r\ntry to win with LEAST turns, each livepoint removes by 1/5.\r\nSo when you win for example after turn 37 and have 7 livepoints, your score is 37 - 7/5 = 35.6\r\nLower score is better.\r\nMAYBE (ohhh, I think so  ) the score should be made more variable, so even two players both witz 37 turns and 7 livepoints left should have different score.\r\nFor making them different, also use the number of cards left in library, lands on the table, cards on the graveyard, ...\r\n(For example, for each card on your graveyard, add 1/5 or ...)\r\n\r\nYes, I believe this could become very well, so there would be a great highscore-table without having lot's of persons with the exact the same score.",
