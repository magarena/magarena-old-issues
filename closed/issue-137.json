      "body": "Nice additional info! Yeah, I think you're right about line 736, it does not take care of CanBlockShadow. \r\n\r\nI think that whole chunk dealing with Shadow in canBeBlocked should be removed as shadow and can block shadow should be handled like flying and reach and it is already taken care of in the canBlock method. \r\n\r\nWill remove the block and test it out to make sure.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",

      "body": "I forgot to add the part about CanBlockShadow when I added that ability. The code in the CanBeBlocked method should have read :\r\nif (MagicAbility.Shadow.hasAbility(flags) &&\t\t(!player.controlsPermanentWithAbility(MagicAbility.Shadow,game)\t\t\t!player.controlsPermanentWithAbility(MagicAbility.CanBlockShadow,game))) {\r\n\treturn false;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nBut I agree that it doesn't need to be there in the first place so I removed that part.\r\n\r\nThanks for spotting this bug!",
