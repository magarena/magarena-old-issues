I am guessing here, but on passing priority to the player, could you just run the same decision process that you would use for the AI but on the player's hand instead to determine whether the player has the capability (eg. an instant) to react to the AI's move (eg. cast a spell)?\n\n**Labels:** -Component-UI  \n",

Perhaps you click on the phase button to indicate you want to pass priority until that phase (unless the opponent casts a spell).",
