      "body": "first: all first strike damage is dealt, meaning the creatures get the damage marker, which, if it is higher than the creature's toughness, makes them die as a state-based effect.\r\n\r\nany triggered abilites resutling from creatures dying are put on the stack, but aren't resolved yet.\r\n\r\nsecond: normal damage is dealt. same as first strike damage.\r\n\r\ncombat damage step ends, end of combat step begins, stack resolves.\r\n\r\nsee: http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Combat_damage_step 510.5. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step. \r\n\r\n510.2. Second, all combat damage that's been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn't use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is assigned and the time it's dealt.  \r\n\r\n510.3. Third, any abilities that triggered on damage being assigned or dealt go on the stack.",
