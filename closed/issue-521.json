  "content": "_From [Landhotel.Westerwald](https://code.google.com/u/Landhotel.Westerwald/) on March 15, 2014 19:18:45_\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem? 1. 2. 3. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Well, that's what happened:\r\nI had Bloodhall Ooze in play for a couple of turns, with Experiment One present. Bloodhall Ooze got its +1/+1 counter every turn (because of the green perm in play). When it was 5/5 (at this time Experiment One evolved once yet, making it a 2/2 creature) it played Miming Slime. A 5/5 green Ooze token enteres battlefield, but Experiment One did not get to evolve again. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
