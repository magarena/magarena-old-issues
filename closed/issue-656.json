      "body": "shawnie & melvin you are both correct. The \"Unimplemented (parse FAIL)\" filter has always been an incomplete parse based on whether CardDefinitions.prop2carddef() works or not. But it does not load abilities so that aspect of a card is not tested. Ultimately, the real test comes when you move a card to the \"scripts\" folder so I think it would be clearer to have a single \"Unimplemented\" filter that displays all unimplemented cards regardless of their parse status.",
