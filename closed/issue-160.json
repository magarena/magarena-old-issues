      "body": "Swapping decks while a duel is ongoing isn't allowed because it would make winning or losing the duel baseless. Now that I think about it, we shouldn't allow editing the deck at those times for the same reason.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can provide an easy way to reset the duel while keeping the same decks. \r\nThe fact that resetting will generate new decks isn't the most logical IMHO and it certainly wasn't what I expected at first. An option could be that resetting means that only the number of games played gets set back to zero and if people want to generate new decks they use the existing 'New Duel' option instead.",

So now you can click on that and swap decks or load decks, any thing you like to customize the duel.\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
