(for reference : <a href=\" http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=3735&p=73902&sid=0f85e1a5a74b0e1497a9ba118dd3b256#p73889\">link</a> He or she mentioned it had something to do with the theme used. I asked about specifics and hope to get an answer on that soon.\r\nYou could try using a different theme and see if that solves the issue.\r\n\r\nOne thing that surprises me is that I don't see the version of Magarena and other system information at the top of the crash.log file. Can you please provide us with the java version and operating system you use?",
