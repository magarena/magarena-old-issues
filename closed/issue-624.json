      "body": "The bug is in the MagicBestowActivation, there is one action to put the card in play and another action to give it MagicStatic.Bestowed. So the card comes into play as a creature, triggers comes into player triggers, then the type Creature is removed. \r\n\r\nThis gap should be closed with something like MagicPlayMod, so the static is given before coming into play triggers are triggered.",

      "body": "Ahh, I see now - Thanks for that.\r\nLooks like the MagicPlayCardFromStackAction would need MagicPlayMod included. I'm not sure if duplicating the MagicPlayCardAction createPermanent() method that gets the playMods would be best. Could it be pushed higher into PutIntoPlayAction?\r\nI'm expecting that MagicPlayCardFromStackAction implementing MagicPlayCardAction would cause problems.\r\nOr combine them together into MagicPlayCardAction and just do a check where the card's coming from?",
