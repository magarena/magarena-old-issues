It is on by default since most times it will only be run once a month when a new version is installed so there is a good chance there might be new high quality cards available. If you run the import process more regularly then you can skip the updater by unticking the option.\r\n\r\nThe updater is still available from the downloads dialog if -DdevMode=true.",
