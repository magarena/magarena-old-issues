      "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nAt first the game used \"you\" everywhere and you had to look at the picture to the left of a message to determine what \"you\" was referring to. We decided this wasn't the most obvious and changed a lot of messages to use the player name instead. The losing game message is one of the things that was forgotten (I never look at the message log when the game already tells me who has lost in the panel on the bottom left).\r\n\r\nI'll fix it right away :)",
