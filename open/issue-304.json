The second blocker was also unnecessary, Soulbound Guardians alone would have destroyed the Pyromancer What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Opponent probably should have blocked both creatures, would have survived at least one more turn that way What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Magarena 1.31, Windows 7 64-bit Please provide any additional information below. I wonder if the computer didn't block Raging Ravine because it didn't recognize it as a creature?
