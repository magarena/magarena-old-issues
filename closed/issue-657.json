This simply displays the other side's image - which might be enough. It does not sync the card-pool which is made trickier because you might have a filtered card pool in which one side of the card is not included. However, even being able to switch the image is an improvement.",

Also, when the cursor moves off of the CardViewer and the alternative image is displayed it automatically switches back the correct image for the selected card aspect.\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
