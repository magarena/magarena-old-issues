      "body": "This is a tricky one:\r\n\r\nCreatures with a 0 toughness die immediately as a state based effect, nothing that uses the stack can save them. In this instance, the Warclub is too slow, so Force of Savagery will die. However, the warclub should stay where it is - so this is a bug.\r\n\r\nAs for Living Weapon, the creating a creature and attaching the equipment both happen at the same time as one item on the stack. So when the 0/0 enters the battlefield, the attachment of the equipment doesn't use the stack. Not even a card with Split Second can get between the two :)\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
