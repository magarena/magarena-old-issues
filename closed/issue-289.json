      "body": "I think this would be a very useful function to easily view new cards which have been recently added. I knocked up some test code that uses the \"date created\" attribute of the script file which only works to a limited degree because the created date is not very reliable. But the actual sorting via # column works fine. \r\n\r\nIf, as mentioned, we could use the version the card was added then it will be a simple case of updating the code from \"date created\" to \"version\". How to associate a card script file with a version is the hard part - the only way I can think of is pre-processing the script files during the CI build process which would add the current build version as a new property to the script file if it is missing. This can then be read as normal into MagicCardDefinition during startup.",
