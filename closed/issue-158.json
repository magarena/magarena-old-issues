      "body": "You are right, I can easily reproduce this.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the game only checks if the player with the lowest amount of life loses the game. This fails in the situation you describe because you are the one with the lowest amount but can't lose due to Platinum Angel's effect. I guess it was done this way because we don't support the game to end in a draw. It's easy to fix this bug by checking each player's life total but I need to find out how that can possibly interfere with the 'no draws' rule or if we perhaps should start supporting draws.\r\n\r\nThanks for the report, I'll get back on this.\n\n**Status:** Accepted  \n",
