      "body": "Thanks for spotting the bug.\r\n\r\nThe card correctly targets only a player but the description given by the game was wrong. I fixed that part.\r\n\r\nNow to the thing you describe with Temporal Isolation:\r\nI think this is correct behavior because the moment the \"when leaves play\" trigger triggers, the attachment is gone and so the damage is no longer prevented. I could be wrong though as timing in this game gets complicated. If you feel that the interaction between Keldon Marauders and Temporal Isolation is still wrong, please open a new issue for that part alone, so we can track one bug per issue.\r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n**Status:** Fixed  \n",
