      "body": "Exactly right. The shock land ability is linked to the MagicRavnicaLandTrigger which only fires once the land is already in play. The land is being tapped by this while already on the battlefield instead of before. The life payment is almost like an alternative cost, but isnt.\r\n\r\nIn fact lots of the tapped into play triggers tap a permanent on the battlefield instead of a play modifier of coming into play tapped.",

      "body": "I tried some combination of cards.\r\n\r\ne.g. play Farseek, choose Stoming Ground, Stomping Ground enters battlefield tapped, whether the life was paid or not. Amulet of Vigor should untap Stomping Ground then.\r\nWhich it does - this works in magarena.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's the same with Perilous Forays and Primeval Titan - tested both - shock land comes into play tapped and is untapped by Amulet of Vigor.\r\n\r\nI have yet to test the spells which put a land on the table untapped.",
