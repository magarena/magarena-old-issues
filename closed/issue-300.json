      "body": "Thanks for the report. The problem is due to the fact that when a creature is removed, its triggers are also removed with it. \r\n\r\nWrath effects causes each creature to be removed one at a time. Depending on when Blood Artist is removed, its trigger will fail to fire after it is removed. Creatures that are removed after Blood Artist will not trigger.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to remove the triggers only after the ALL the creatures from the wrath effect are removed.",
